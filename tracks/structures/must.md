## Must - (Chahiye)

**"Must"** ka use hum tab karte hain jab hume kuch strongly suggest karna ho ya zaroorat ko emphasize karna ho. Yeh obligation ya necessity ko indicate karta hai, matlab "karna hi padega."

**Examples:**<br>

**Obligation ya zaroorat ke liye:**<br>
"You must study hard to pass the exam." (Tumhe exam pass karne ke liye hard study karni hi hogi.)<br>
"I must go now, it's getting late." (Mujhe ab jaana hi hoga, late ho raha hai.)<br>

**Strong recommendation ya suggestion ke liye:**<br>
"You must try this dish, it's amazing!" (Tumhe yeh dish zaroor try karni chahiye, yeh amazing hai!)<br>
"If you visit Shimla, you must go to the Mall Road." (Agar tum Shimla jaate ho toh Mall Road zaroor jaana chahiye.)<br>

**Logical conclusion ke liye:**<br>
"He must be tired after working all day." (Woh poore din kaam karne ke baad thak gaya hoga.)<br>
"She must have reached home by now." (Woh ab tak ghar pohanch gayi hogi.)<br>

**"Must"** ka istemal jab hum kuch strongly kehna chahte hain ya zaroori maan rahe hain, tab hota hai.
