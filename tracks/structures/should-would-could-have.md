The difference between "could have" and "would have" mainly lies in possibility vs. intention or hypothetical outcome.


---

1. Could Have (Possibility or Ability)

"Could have" is used when talking about something that was possible or an opportunity someone had in the past, even if it didn’t happen. It emphasizes that there was a chance or ability to do something, but it wasn't necessarily done.


Examples:

"I could have gone to the party, but I chose not to." (I had the option or ability to go, but I didn’t.)

"She could have studied harder for the exam." (It was possible for her to study harder, but she didn’t.)


2. Would Have (Hypothetical Outcome or Intention)

"Would have" is used when imagining what would have happened if certain conditions were met. It expresses a hypothetical situation or an intended outcome that didn't happen because of certain reasons.

Examples:

"I would have gone to the party if I had finished my homework." (I wanted to go, and it was likely I would have gone, but only if I’d finished my homework.)

"They would have helped us if we had asked." (They intended or were willing to help, but we didn’t ask, so they didn’t help.)

In Short:

Could have = possibility or ability (but it didn’t happen).

Would have = hypothetical or intended outcome (depends on a specific condition that wasn’t met).



Using them in the same sentence:

"I could have passed the exam if I had studied harder."
(It was possible, but I didn’t study enough.)

"I would have passed the exam if I had studied harder."
(Passing would have been the outcome if I had put in more effort.)
